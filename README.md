### Delete All LinkedIn Posts

Automates the process of deleting all posts from your LinkedIn activity feed.

- **What it does:**  
  Scrolls through your recent activity, opens each post’s options menu, clicks “Delete post”, and confirms—all in one run.

- **How to use:**  
  1. Navigate to your posts page:  
     `https://www.linkedin.com/in/{username}/recent-activity/all/`
  2. Open your browser’s Developer Console (`F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I`)
  3. Paste and execute the script from [`delete-all-linkedin-posts.js`](delete-all-linkedin-posts.js)
  4. The script handles all confirmations and deletes every available post automatically

- **Note:**  
  - This script is for personal use only.
  - LinkedIn UI may change, requiring updates to the script.
  - Use at your own risk (LinkedIn may limit or flag aggressive automation).

**Happy automating!**
